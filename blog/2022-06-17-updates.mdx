Hey hey hey ðŸ‘‹! The Data Platform Team is here with the weekly updates. We keep working on the same things: Alert Feature for DevConsole and Data Warehouse.

This week:

<!-- truncate -->

- Started the work on REST API on the top of our Postgres DB, we want to provide the balances info for the native token and FTs. Feel free to share any thoughts on the issues here: https://github.com/telezhnaya/near_enhanced_api (@telezhnaya)
- We've designed the DB schema for Alerts and started implementing basic Alert Rules. The basic queue of Alerts needs to be implemented to have all the blocks in place, at least at a basic level. After that, we would be able to work on empowering the Alertexer with more rules and features (@khorolets)

And that's all for this week. Stay tuned, reach out if you have any questions. See you all next week!
