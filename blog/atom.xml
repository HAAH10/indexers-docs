Great job!</li><li>We're finishing up the backfilling of the data for NEAR Lake to AWS S3. It's almost done for both testnet and mainnet. I want to remind you that all the up-to-date data is being stored and is already ready to be used. I guess a few more days left to finish the process. (@khorolets)</li><li>ðŸ˜‡ We keep working on rewriting Indexer for Explorer on top of NEAR Lake Framework, switching it to use SingleStore instead of PostgreSQL. To give you some details we're planning the changes to the database structure and choosing the most appropriate libraries.

We are looking forward to hearing from you what do you think about NEAR Lake Framework. Please, share your usage stories, we'd like to promote your indexers built on top of NEAR Lake Framework, it can inspire other projects. Your success stories may lead to even more great projects in our ecosystem.</p><p>That's all for this week. Stay tuned! Looking forward to seeing you next week.

We're changing the data storage for Indexer for Explorer from PostgreSQL to SingleStore, it should improve the stability of the data flow and it should end up improving the stability of NEAR Explorer. At least in terms of data availability and decreasing the possible interruptions.</p><p>Since the previous update:</p><ul><li>We continue backfilling the data for NEAR Lake to AWS S3. You can see the updates in <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake/issues/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this issue</a>. For the record, we fill in some historical data for mainnet and testnet. All the fresh data is already available. (@khorolets)</li><li>Small yet important improvement on the <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/pull/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near-lake-framework</a> has been delivered. This will ensure the user gets consistent data without any gaps. (@khorolets)</li><li>Also, today we have added some useful debug logging to NEAR Lake Framework (@khorolets)</li><li>We have done some cost estimation to find out how much money a user will need to run a single instance of an indexer on top of NEAR Lake Framework. The numbers are quite exciting. Approximately $18.15 per month. See <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework#cost-estimates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the README section and explanation</a> by yourself. @(khorolets)</li><li>Ah, and we have launched a small project <a href="https://github.com/khorolets/near-lake-pulse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>near-lake-pulse</code></a> just to check if we have all the data stored on S3 consistently. The project is providing an endpoint with metrics for Prometheus. The source code might be used for inspiration (@khorolets)</li><li>We are moving forward to the public announcement of NEAR Lake, probably next week. We're going to invite early adopters. Stay tuned!</li><li>We have added a new table at <a href="https://github.com/near/near-analytics/commit/9e2e6f774a42909d23c4cfda805f88cd84333304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near-analytics</a>, it gives the understanding of average gas burnt between transactions (@telezhnaya)</li><li>Meanwhile we are writing/rewriting NEAR Indexer for Explorer to NEAR Lake and SingleStore as a storage <a href="https://github.com/telezhnaya/near-lake-flows-into-sql-base" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (@telezhnaya)</li></ul><p>It's been a tough month for everyone.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ðŸ‘‹ How's it going, everyone? Seems like we are renaming to Data Team ðŸ¤·, so Data Team is here with fresh weekly updates. All the week we were working on <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAR Lake</a> pushing it to <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake/milestone/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVP release</a> as hard as we could.</p><p>Since the previous week:</p><ul><li>We have finished the revision of the <code>StreamerMessage</code> structure and decided to leave it as-is for now. In the future, we plan to adjust the way the underlying structures are serialized to JSON, but this is going to be in the future.</li><li>NEAR Lake has been deployed to both testnet and mainnet networks in order to index the data from the genesis. (@khorolets)
Unfortunately, or maybe, fortunately, yesterday we've noticed that the <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake/issues/23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order of the data we get from S3 is somehow broken</a>. It happens because the object keys on S3 are strings and we forgot about the way numbers represented in strings are being sorted ðŸ¤¦. But <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake/pull/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the fix</a> is on the way and we will restart the indexing process one more time. (@khorolets)</li><li>Meanwhile, NEAR Lake has been empowered with the CI ðŸ’ª. However, some differences between the environment we build the release in and the servers we run it on causes problems. You can follow the progress by subscribing to <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake/issues/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this issue</a>. We'll figure it out. (@khorolets)</li><li>NEAR Lake Framework <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/pull/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been refactored</a>. We are trying different API approaches but looks like we are done here. (@khorolets)</li><li>Check out the new <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fancy README for NEAR Lake Framework</a> we wrote this week. (@khorolets)</li></ul><p>That's all for this week, folks! Thanks for being with us all this week. Please, have a great and peaceful weekend! Looking forward to see you all next week! Let's keep rocking! ðŸ¤˜</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greeting from the Indexer Team. At least from that part of the team who is not having a vacation yet ðŸ¤ª</p><p>We've brought some exciting news about our progress this week.</p><p>Indexer Team is focused on Lightweight NEAR Indexer infrastructure and Indexer for Explorer. The majority of our work this week was about a brand new indexer <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAR Lake</a>. Enjoy the weekly update with us:</p><ul><li>In the process of revising the <code>StreamerMessage</code> struct (<a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>) we:<ul><li>Made an extraction of indexer-related types to a separate crate <code>near-indexer-primitives</code> and it is going to be published to crates.io very soon, hopefully. (@khorolets)</li><li>Moved <code>state_changes</code> field from the top-level of the <code>StreamerMessage</code> to the <code>IndexerShard</code> along with additional post-processing that enables the division of the <code>StateChanges</code> by the shard (<a href="https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref PR</a>) (@khorolets)</li></ul></li><li>NEAR Lake project is developing:<ul><li>Now it has a README with the description of the concept and the reason for existing. Please, <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have a look at the README.md</a> (@khorolets)</li><li>NEAR Lake ecosystem friends arriving at the party. Meet <a href="https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEAR Lake Framework</a> in its early days and first step (@khorolets)
The coolest thing about the <code>near-lake-framework</code> is that it depends only on <code>near-indexer-primitives</code> and doesn't require the entire <code>nearcore</code>! It can be built on Apple M1 and run on it smoothly.</li><li>And a small yet working project <code>near-lake-raw-printer</code>, built on top of NEAR Lake Framework has been created. Think of it as about a starting point for the projects that use the NEAR Lake Framework and are capable of doing something with the raw data from the NEAR Lake (@khorolets)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Both projects <code>near-lake-framework</code> and <code>near-lake-raw-printer</code> have been just published and missed the README. Also, they are not finalized, so it's too early to start using them.</p><p>Worth mentioning that we have started the node with NEAR Lake instance for the <code>testnet</code> ðŸŽ‰ and it is running from the genesis, filling the AWS S3 bucket with the data.</p><p>That's all for today, see you next week. Let's keep rocking! ðŸ¤˜</p>]]></content>
