Hey everyone! As you remember a few weeks ago a Data Platform Community Meeting had happened. Finally, we've published a record from the meeting to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5nG77ReU4g)

We was talking about:
- the team's goals for this quoter
- the history of Indexers in NEAR Protocol
- the Data in NEAR Protocol, who is relying on it, what challenges we are facing with, what are we going to do

Enjoy the video, feel free to ask questions in the comments under the video, leave a feedback about the Community Meeting and maybe what do you want us to speak about next time.
