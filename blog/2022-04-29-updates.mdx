ðŸ‘‹ Hey hey hey! The Data Platform team is here! We've brought the traditional portion of weekly updates.

We believe this week had a historical meaning: the first Data Platform community meeting had happened. It was a pleasure to see all of you! (Follow the [NEAR YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/NEARProtocol/videos) if you missed the meeting, the record will be published soon).

We've posted a survey during the community meeting, please participate if you haven't. We need your opinion!

Let's get to updates:

<!-- truncate -->

* ðŸŽ‰ [`near-lake-framework`](https://crates.io/crates/near-lake-framework) is published to the crates.io (@khorolets)
* The TypeScript/JavaScript version of [NEAR Lake Framework](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-js/pull/1) is under review and soon it will be available for early adopters (@khorolets)
* We still working on [NEAR Lake Flow into SQL Base](https://github.com/telezhnaya/near-lake-flows-into-sql-base). We encourage you to participate in discussions on the issues (@telezhnaya)
* We have added a new article to the Indexers Docs [Migrating to NEAR Lake Framework](https://near-indexers.io/tutorials/lake/migrating-to-near-lake-framework) (@khorolets)
* Also, we have filled up the Indexers Docs [pages about structures](https://near-indexers.io/docs/data-flow-and-structures/structures/toc). We're going to extend those in the future (@khorolets)

That's all for now. There is going to be `1.26.0-rc.2` `nearcore` release on testnet next Wednesday, we will update [the post with instructions](https://github.com/near/nearcore/discussions/6656), so stay tuned!

*Don't forget, the Data Platform Community meeting is going to happen every 4th Thursday of the month. We are looking forward to seeing all of you, [please, join us](http://near.ai/data-platform-meetings)!*

See you all next week ðŸ¤˜!
