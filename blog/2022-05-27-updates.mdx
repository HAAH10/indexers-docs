How's it going everyone ðŸ‘‹? The Data Team is here to announce that "the weekend is coming!"

This week we had a Community Meeting, it was a pleasure to see all of you there, that was fun, we'll share the recording for those who miss the call next week, hopefully.

Here are this week's updates:

<!-- truncate -->

- This week we testing out AWS Aurora DB, AWS RedShift, GCP AlloyDB and trying to figure out whether it could be a good choice for Indexer migration. (@telezhnaya)
- We have published a new tutorial ["Building an NFT indexer"](https://near-indexers.io/tutorials/lake/nft-indexer) describing the [Events Format](https://nomicon.io/Standards/EventsFormat) concept and NEAR Lake Framework JS (@khorolets)
- NEAR Lake Framework JS 1.0.3 with performance improvements has been published. Kudos to @vgrichina for your contributions!
- We keep working on empowering the DevConsole with Alerts Feature. We're building an indexer on our side that will be watching the network for a set of user-configured events. The codename for the indexer is Alertexer. At the moment it's in a very early stage (@khorolets)

That's pretty much all for this week. Stay tuned, so you don't miss any news from the Data Platform Team. See you next week!

Have a question about indexers? Post it on [StackOverflow with tags `nearprotocol` and `indexer`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nearprotocol+indexer) to get an answer!
