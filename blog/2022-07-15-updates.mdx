Happy Monday everyone! The Data Platform Team is getting back to work after a wellness week. We've resumed the work we've been doing: pushing toward the Alerts Feature for the DevConsole to a release and working on the Enhanced API.

Updates for the week:

<!-- truncate -->

- Working on REST API on the top of our Postgres DB and RPC to provide the balances info for the native token, FTs, and NFTs. Feel free to share any thoughts on the issues here: https://github.com/near/near-enhanced-api-server. [See the demo on Community Meeting](https://youtu.be/LyE7LLeMHFE?t=187) (@telezhnaya)
- Empowering the Alerts Feature with the [Events Standard](https://nomicon.io/Standards/EventsFormat) alerts (@khorolets)
- Working on e-mails delivery channel for Alerts Feature (@khorolets)

That's pretty much all for this week. Stay tuned!

Se you all!
