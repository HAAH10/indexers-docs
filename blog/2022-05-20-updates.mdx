Let's move on to the updates:

<!-- truncate -->

- We keep working on the account activity table. As a reminder, it will be used to display the historical activity on the accounts (Wallet, Explorer, DevConsole). It will feature receipts-level granularity and validators rewards (@telezhnaya)
- [NEAR Lake Framework](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/releases/tag/v0.4.0) version 0.4.0 is released ðŸŽ‰. Again, it introduces a breaking change, so please, pay attention. While breaking changes might be irritative and unpleasant, we are actively developing the library and there might be a few breaking changes here and there until 1.0.0 release anyway. We thank you for your patience and support! (@khorolets)
- And [NEAR Lake Framework JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/near-lake-framework/v/1.0.2) version 1.0.2 is released, no breaking changes, improved performance. (@khorolets)
- We have started the work related to the Indexer as a Service integrated into the DevConsole. I hope we would be able to share details very soon. Stay tuned (@khorolets)

And it seems to be all for this week. Looking forward to seeing you all at [the Data Platform Community Meeting] on Thursday, May 26. Don't forget ðŸ˜‰

Have a great weekend! See ya!
