Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹! This is the Data Platform Team with the weekly updates.

First of all, we invite you to this month's Data Platform Community Meeting.

Our team keeps working on Enhanced APIs and Alert Feature for DevConsole.

Let's get to the updates:

- Working on REST API on the top of our Postgres DB, we want to provide the balances info for the native token, FTs, and NFTs. Feel free to share any thoughts on the issues here: https://github.com/telezhnaya/near_enhanced_api (@telezhnaya)
- At this moment we have the working flow for Alert Feature with the Webhook delivery channel. And we keep working on the integration of all the pieces together to create a demo-able setup (@khorolets)
- ðŸŽ‰ Meanwhile, [NEAR Lake Framework Rust 0.5.0](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework-rs/releases/tag/v0.5.0) has been released. This release drops the previously available initiation of `LakeConfig` in favor of the builder pattern. Overall stability and the speed has been increased (@frol, @khorolets)

And this is it for this week. Looking forward to meeting you all at the Community Meeting this Thursday. See you all!
