Greetings from the Data Platform Team ðŸ‘‹! The week moves towards its end and we are here with the regular weekly updates.

The prime focus of our team is the Alert Feature for DevConsole and a new version of the indexer for Explorer.

Here are more detailed updates:

<!-- truncate -->

- We continue our work on a new indexer for Explorer (@telezhnaya)
    - This week we've managed to create a draft of the indexer for the rest of the tables (`accounts`, `access_keys`)
- Meanwhile, we continue working on testing AWS Aurora and GCP AlloyDB databases (@telezhnaya)
- As for Alert Feature we've created an indexer with the codename Alertexer and it is able to watch for an account being a party of a transaction from Transaction itself till the last ExecutionOutcome. Firing alert yet to be done (@khorolets)

That's all for this week. The Alert Feature became our top priority, so most of the time we're going to work on that. We hope to bring you more news about it in the following weeks. Stay tuned!

Have a great weekend you all!
