How's it going, everyone? The Data Platform Teams is here, though you knew it before you started to read it, did you? üòò

It was a pleasure to see you all at our Community Meeting. Quick recap if you've missed it while the recording is not published:

- We've done a recap of the purpose of existing the Indexer toolset and where to find the docs about it. https://near-indexers.io
- We've given an overview of the state of NEAR Enhanced APIs
- Announced the [NEAR Lake Framework on Python](https://github.com/frolvanya/near-lake-framework-py) üêç

OK, let's move on to this week's updates:
<!-- truncate -->

- Our shiny [Near Enhanced API](https://github.com/near/near-enhanced-api-server) is in the active stage of development!
    - We have made one more step to support pagination in the API: added tracking of absolute amount values for FT contracts in the DB https://github.com/near/near-indexer-events (@telezhnaya)
    - Added the info about failed FT/NFT movements to the Indexer DB (@telezhnaya)
    - Working on the support of [legacy contracts](https://github.com/near/near-indexer-events) (`wrap.near` and others). It will allow us to show `wrap.near` data in the [API](https://github.com/near/near-enhanced-api-server) (@telezhnaya)
- Alert Feature for DevConsole is now empowered with Account Balances rules. Users can set up an Alert when their balances are changed in either a range of amounts or a range of percents (@khorolets)

That's pretty much all for this week. Stay tuned, stay with us! Don't stop rocking ü§ò See you all next week!
