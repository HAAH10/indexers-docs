# NEAR Lake Framework

:::note GitHub repo

https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/

:::

## Description

NEAR Lake Framework is a small library companion to [NEAR Lake](./near-lake). It allows you to build your own indexer that subscribes to the stream of blocks from the [NEAR Lake](./near-lake) data source and create your own logic to process the NEAR Protocol data.

:::tip NEAR Lake Framework announcement

We have announced the release of NEAR Lake Framework on NEAR Gov forum

Please, read the post [there](https://gov.near.org/t/announcement-near-lake-framework-brand-new-word-in-indexer-building-approach/17668)

## Why is it better than [NEAR Indexer Framework](./near-indexer-framework)

- MVP version of NEAR Lake Framework consumes **~145MB of RAM** and we’re going to improve it
- It doesn’t depend on [`nearcore`](https://github.com/near/nearcore) and it is not a NEAR node so you don’t need to upgrade it every time nearcore cuts a release
- No syncing process is involved anymore, so even if your indexer got stuck you can restart it from any block and run with it immediately
- There is no huge data folder anymore, so you don’t need to pay for quite expensive 1TB SSD drives
- Want to debug your indexer on mainnet locally? No problem, do whatever you need
