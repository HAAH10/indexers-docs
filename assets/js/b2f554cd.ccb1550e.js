If you run an indexer already, please consider migrating to NEAR Lake Framework. This will drastically decrease your spending on infrastructure and eventually will minimize the time you need to maintain your indexers.\\n\\nSo, since the previous week:\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n* \ud83c\udf89 We have publicly [announced the release of NEAR Lake Framework on the NEAR Gov forum](https://gov.near.org/t/announcement-near-lake-framework-brand-new-word-in-indexer-building-approach/17668) (@khorolets)\\n* \ud83d\ude31 In addition to the announcement we\'ve published a video tutorial on [how to use NEAR Lake Framework on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsF7I93K-EQ). Please watch it, like it, and subscribe to the channel, you know what to do (@khorolets)\\n* Worth mentioning, the [source code for the tutorial](https://github.com/near-examples/near-lake-accounts-watcher) is available on GitHub (@khorolets)\\n* Just for the sake, we have rolled the [0.1.0 release of NEAR Lake indexer](https://github.com/near/near-lake/releases/tag/0.1.0). It\'s the one the Data Platform Team is running to provide data on AWS S3 for everyone (@khorolets)\\n* \ud83e\udd70 By the way we thank @gueux for the contribution to NEAR Lake projects that allow developers to use S3 compatible services (e.g. for local development). Great job!\\n* We\'re finishing up the backfilling of the data for NEAR Lake to AWS S3. It\'s almost done for both testnet and mainnet. I want to remind you that all the up-to-date data is being stored and is already ready to be used. I guess a few more days left to finish the process. (@khorolets)\\n* \ud83d\ude07 We keep working on rewriting Indexer for Explorer on top of NEAR Lake Framework, switching it to use SingleStore instead of PostgreSQL. To give you some details we\'re planning the changes to the database structure and choosing the most appropriate libraries. We are going to start giving more details when there be any interesting ones. (@telezhnaya)\\n* And don\'t anyone for now, but we\'re working on NEAR Lake Framework JS, but shhh \ud83e\udd2b (@khorolets)\\n\\nI think the week was great and full of successful results \ud83d\ude05. We are looking forward to hearing from you what do you think about NEAR Lake Framework. Please, share your usage stories, we\'d like to promote your indexers built on top of NEAR Lake Framework, it can inspire other projects. Your success stories may lead to even more great projects in our ecosystem.\\n\\nThat\'s all for this week. Stay tuned!

(@khorolets)\\n* Small yet important improvement on the [near-lake-framework](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework/pull/11) has been delivered. This will ensure the user gets consistent data without any gaps. (@khorolets)\\n* Also, today we have added some useful debug logging to NEAR Lake Framework (@khorolets)\\n* We have done some cost estimation to find out how much money a user will need to run a single instance of an indexer on top of NEAR Lake Framework. The numbers are quite exciting. Approximately $18.15 per month. See [the README section and explanation](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework#cost-estimates) by yourself. @(khorolets)\\n* Ah, and we have launched a small project [`near-lake-pulse`](https://github.com/khorolets/near-lake-pulse) just to check if we have all the data stored on S3 consistently. The project is providing an endpoint with metrics for Prometheus. The source code might be used for inspiration (@khorolets)\\n* We are moving forward to the public announcement of NEAR Lake, probably next week. We\'re going to invite early adopters. Stay tuned!\\n* We have added a new table at [near-analytics](https://github.com/near/near-analytics/commit/9e2e6f774a42909d23c4cfda805f88cd84333304), it gives the understanding of average gas burnt between transactions (@telezhnaya)\\n* Meanwhile we are writing/rewriting NEAR Indexer for Explorer to NEAR Lake and SingleStore as a storage [here](https://github.com/telezhnaya/near-lake-flows-into-sql-base) (@telezhnaya)\\n\\nIt\'s been a tough month for everyone.

Please, [have a look at the README.md](https://github.com/near/near-lake#readme) (@khorolets)\\n  * NEAR Lake ecosystem friends arriving at the party. Meet [NEAR Lake Framework](https://github.com/near/near-lake-framework) in its early days and first step (@khorolets)\\n  The coolest thing about the `near-lake-framework` is that it depends only on `near-indexer-primitives` and doesn\'t require the entire `nearcore`! It can be built on Apple M1 and run on it smoothly.\\n  * And a small yet working project `near-lake-raw-printer`, built on top of NEAR Lake Framework has been created. Think of it as about a starting point for the projects that use the NEAR Lake Framework and are capable of doing something with the raw data from the NEAR Lake (@khorolets)\\n\\nBoth projects `near-lake-framework` and `near-lake-raw-printer` have been just published and missed the README. Also, they are not finalized, so it\'s too early to start using them.\\n\\nWorth mentioning that we have started the node with NEAR Lake instance for the `testnet` \ud83c\udf89 and it is running from the genesis, filling the AWS S3 bucket with the data.\\n\\nThat\'s all for today, see you next week.
